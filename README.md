# GraphQL for Vim

This Vim plugin provides [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) file detection, syntax
highlighting, and indentation. It currently targets the [October 2021
Edition](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/) of the GraphQL specification.

The core runtime files are also included with Vim 9.1.0955+. They provide the
foundational support (ftplugin, indent, syntax) for the `graphql` filetype.
This plugin includes the most up-to-date version of those runtime files as well
as support for embedding GraphQL syntax inside of other filetype buffers (such
as JavaScript).

## Installation

This plugin requires Vim version 8 or later. Equivalent Neovim versions
are also supported.

### Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

1. Add `Plug 'jparise/vim-graphql'` to `~/.vimrc`
2. `vim +PluginInstall +qall`

### Using Vim Packages

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/jparise/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/jparise/start
git clone https://github.com/jparise/vim-graphql.git graphql
vim -u NONE -c "helptags graphql/doc" -c q
```

## Syntax Highlighting

Complete syntax highlighting is enabled for the `graphql` [filetype][]. This
filetype is automatically selected for filenames ending in `.gql`, `.graphql`,
and `.graphqls`.

If you would like to enable automatic syntax support for more file extensions
(e.g., `*.prisma`), create a file named `~/.vim/after/ftdetect/graphql.vim`
containing autocommand lines like:

```vim
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.prisma setfiletype graphql
```

## JavaScript and TypeScript Support

GraphQL syntax support inside of [ES2015 template literals][templates] is
provided. It works "out of the box" with Vim 8.2+'s JavaScript and TypeScript
language support. The extended JavaScript syntax provided by the
[vim-javascript][] plugin is also supported.

For older versions of Vim, TypeScript support can be enabled by installing the
[yats][] plugin.

[templates]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates
[vim-javascript]: https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript
[yats]: https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme/yats.vim

```javascript
const query = gql`
  {
    user(id: ${uid}) {
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
`);
```

The list of recognized tag names is defined by the `g:graphql_javascript_tags`
variable, which defaults to `["gql", "graphql", "Relay.QL"]`. This can also
be set on a per-buffer basis using the `b:graphql_javascript_tags` variable.

Untagged template literals passed as the first argument to specific functions
can also be recognized. `g:graphql_javascript_functions` defines this list of
functions, which defaults to `["graphql"]`. This list can also be set on a
per-buffer basis using the `b:graphql_javascript_functions` variable.

```javascript
const query = graphql(`
  {
    user(id: ${uid}) {
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
`;
```

You can also add a `# gql` or `# graphql` comment at the start of a template
string to indicate that its contents should be considered GraphQL syntax.

```javascript
const query = `# gql
  {
    user(id: ${uid}) {
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
`;
```

Syntax highlighting within `.jsx` / `.tsx` files is also supported. These
filetypes can be "compound" (`javascript.jsx` and `typescript.tsx`) or use the
"react" variants (`javascriptreact` and `typescriptreact`).

Syntax highlighting is also available within [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
templates.

## ReasonML Support

GraphQL syntax support inside of [ReasonML](https://reasonml.org/) template
strings using [graphql-ppx][] is available.

```reason
[%graphql {|
  query UserQuery {
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
|}];
```

The `%relay` extension point is also supported.

## ReScript Support

GraphQL syntax support inside of [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/)
strings is available.

```rescript
%graphql(`
  query UserQuery {
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`)
```

The [`%relay` extension node][%relay] is also supported.

## PHP Support

GraphQL syntax inside of [heredoc][] and [nowdoc][] strings is supported. The
string identifier must be named `GQL` (case-insensitive).

```php
<?php
$my_query = <<<GQL
{
  user(id: ${uid}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
GQL;
```

[nowdoc]: https://www.php.net/manual/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc

## Language Server Protocol Support

[Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://langserver.org/) implementations can
enable editor features like schema-aware completion. This plugin does not
implement the Language Server Protocol, but here are some others that do:

- [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) supports
  [GraphQL language servers](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Language-servers#graphql)

## Testing

The test suite uses [Vader.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim). To run
all of the tests from the command line:

```sh
make test
```
